RingFit is a real-time data engineering project that implements a Lakehouse architecture using Databricks, Azure ADLS Gen2, Kafka, Azure Data Factory, and Unity Catalog for a fitness ring manufacturing company.

The fitness ring continuously captures health and activity data from users and streams it to backend systems. This project focuses on building a scalable, secure, and governed analytics platform while keeping operational systems decoupled from analytical workloads.
